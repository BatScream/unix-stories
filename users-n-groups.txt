a) Doing a ls -ltr on the root directory yielded me the below result. I had not seen anything like "wheel" in the groups section.

drwxr-xr-x   3 root  wheel   102 Feb  8 21:37 data

After googling a bit i came to know that it is a group, whose members can use the "su" utility in order to change to "root". Again, if the file's owner is "root", why is the user group "wheel"? By default, "root" is a member of the "wheel" group. Removing the root user from the wheel would not change things. This is purely formal.

b) Mongodb was Unable the "data" directory. 

Saw that the directory was owned by "root", and since i was in the "wheel" group, i was able to start mongod instance using the "sudo mongod" command. But it would run as the "root" user. So i had to change the ownership of the "data" directory from "root" to me.

The command, fixed it:

chown -R batscream data 

Then i gave read and nexecute access to myself:

chmod -R u+rX data
